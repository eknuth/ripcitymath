  <p>I typically offer hour-long sessions of private math tutoring in my SE Portland home. My rate starting Fall 2014 is $30/hour. An initial 30-minute meet and greet session is offered free of charge if you like, to be sure of a good fit for all parties involved. Please see my calendar for current availability, payment options, booking and cancelling appointments. If you must cancel, please do so within 24 hours to avoid incurring a full session charge. If your child is ill the morning of the session, or an emergency arises, please let me know as soon as possible. These incidences are understandable and will not incur any charge. Please communicate about school holidays if you will or won't be coming. </p>
