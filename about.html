        <h3>What I Do</h3>

      <p>
        I offer after-school tutoring and summer workshops to help kids in kindergarten through 8th grades with their math homework, build their skills and confidence, offer challenging and playful enrichment opportunities. I will support and encourage your child in persistence, preparedness, and learning from mistakes.

        <p>
            Being good at math does not come naturally to many of us. It takes hard work, preparation, and confidence in yourself. The pace of modern classrooms in the U.S. is often rapid and does not allow for much think-time, open discussion, or questions. There are a multitude of mathematics curriculums, all with their strengths and weaknesses and specific emphases. 
          
          I firmly believe the ideal approach to math learning is student-led, playful, and cooperative. I help create a positive environment for math discovery with a focus on studying patterns and structures in our world and using words, numbers, and operations to try and describe them. Kids are encouraged to ask questions of the group (when in a group environment), listen mindfully to responses, and engage in games and discussions in order to build a deep comraderie over time. Students are given the opportunity to process math learning in their own unique and creative ways through music, art, writing, lecture, performance, comic, etc.. This process helps kids personalize math, associate it with good feelings, and know there are as many approaches to learning and knowing math as there are individuals.
