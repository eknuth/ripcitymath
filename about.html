        <h3>What I Do</h3>

        <p>
            Being good at math does not come naturally to many of us. It takes hard work, preparation, and confidence in yourself. The pace of modern classrooms in the U.S. is often rapid and does not allow for much think-time, open discussion, or questions. There are a multitude of mathematics curriculums, all with their strengths and weaknesses and specific emphases. 
        <h3>Who I Am</h3>
        <p>
            I offer after-school tutoring and summer workshops to help kids in kindergarten through 8th grades with their math homework, build their skills and confidence, offer challenging and playful enrichment opportunities. I will support and encourage your child in persistence and learning from mistakes.
