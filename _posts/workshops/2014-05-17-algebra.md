Algebra is the study of relationships. Come learn about this often intimidating subject in this 2-day workshop series.
All workshops emphasize respectful comraderie, cooperative learning, question-asking, and use a hands-on, playful, student-led approach.

##Algebra I
You will be introduced to the language of algebra, practice translating word problems to an algebra expression or equation, learn how letters (variables) are used to express the unknown, learn how to solve for x in simple equations, and plot points on a coordinate plane.

##Algebra II
You will learn how to find the slope of a line and through solving a story problem learn about linear equations and how to express them and look for patterns to find the missing parts. You will also learn what a function is, including the concepts of range and domain. We will work in teams to create function machines.
