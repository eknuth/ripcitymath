Are you a creative person who loves to draw? Me too! This doesn't exclude you from enjoying the beauty mathematics has to offer.

Math is about patterns and relationships and how things change over time. If you record these artisticly, you can create some beautiful art! This session is 2 hours long so you actually have time to create something to take home with you. You will be seated in table groups and materials will be provided.

A lot of mathematically inspired art is geometric. Some forms of art you will learn about are tesselations, Islamic Tiles, 3D nets that fold into boxes, fractals, snowflakes, and pentagon/hexagon/octagon stars. After learning about these various art forms, you will get to choose what you would like to work on and take home. You will also get to take home a "how to" for the other types of art discussed. We will take a tour break to walk around the room and see what art others are creating.

Although many materials will be provided, it's always nice to not have to wait until someone else is done, so feel free to bring any of the following for your own personal use or to share: ruler, compass, fancy markers/pens/pencils, scissors, stencils, etc. If you do so, you are responsible for keeping track of your own belongings.
