If Mary wore blue, the girl across from her ate ice cream and Marco had a pet fish, who sat next to Luis?

Have you ever come across a logic puzzle that made you dizzy just by reading it? Sometimes called Einstein Puzzles, this type of logic puzzle (in which you must figure out who is wearing what color, what order they are seated in, what pet they each have, etc.) uses deductive reasoning skills. This is a skill in which American students are sorely lacking, compared to our global counterparts. Its also so much fun and quite addicting!

You will be guided through one puzzle, step by step, to completion. Afterwards we will split into groups and you can choose to work on your own, with your family or friends, or with me in second guided session.

There will be numerous puzzles from which to choose to solve and take home with you as well as resources on where to find more Online, including a great app.
